# ðŸ‘‹ Hello friends

My name is Hardy Johnson, I am a long time web, software, security and infrastructure developer. My interest in the web 
has always been as a democratizing force which lowers the barrier of entry to the world of publishing for billions of 
people. Little did anyone know what a broad and deep application platform / ecosystem it would become.

Over the years I have been lucky to make to work with many amazing software developers and companies building innovative
products and services across a wide spectrum of industries including performance marketing, content marketing,
e-commerce, health, financial services, short term rentals and software as a service.

My wife, big trees, bigger mountains, wild rivers and an untamed coast dotted with breweries and gastronomic pleasures 
brought me to Portland, Oregon. You can find me enjoying music in and around the Pacific Northwest, downhill skiing on 
Mt. Hood and enjoying beers that are hoppier than reason would dictate. I also love traveling and spending time with my 
family and furry friends (dogs).
